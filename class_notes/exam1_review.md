    * How to properly write and evaluate if controls structures that are nested
* 4.6
    * These if/else if control structures are just and if/else control structure with and if following the else. If you know how to use if/else and how nested if works then this is just a silly section.
* 4.7  
    * This section doesn't get much into flags however you need to know what flags are (bools), how to evaluate them, and also using them with file I/O (std::fstream::in is a flag)
