Write a simple program that will compute exam averages writing information to a file. 

In the program you will do the following:
* Receive 4 exam scores from the user (as integers).
* Receive the 4 points possible for the exams from the user (as integers).
* Open a file named *grades.txt* for output.
* Output the following to *grades.txt* :
    * On the first line output the exam scores all on the same line separated by a space.
    * On the second line output the points possible for each exam all on the same line separated by a space.
    * On the third line output the exam average as a percentage with a single decimal.

>Example of expected output in *grades.txt*:

    40 50 60 70
    100 100 100 100
    55.0%

>Example of expected output in *grades.txt*:

    78 45 67 12
    100 50 75 20
