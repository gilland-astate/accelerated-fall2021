# Exercise 3 - Input/Output with Casting

Write a simple program that will compute exam averages. 

We will prompt the user to input the following: 
* 4 exam scores (as integers)
* 4 points possible for the exams (as integers)

You will then calculate and output the following: 
* Total points of combined exams (as integer)
* Total points possible of combined exams (as integer)
* The average of the exams (as decimal with 1 place)
