# Exercise 3 - Input/Output with Casting

Write a simple program that will compute exam averages. 

We will prompt the user to input the following: 
* 4 exam scores (as integers)
* 4 points possible for the exams (as integers)

You will then calculate and output the following: 
* Total points of combined exams scores (as integer)
* Total points possible of combined exams (as integer)
* The average of the exams (as decimal with 1 place)

>Example of expected output:

    Enter the 4 exam scores (seperated by spaces or new lines): 40 50 60 70
    Enter the points possible for the 4 exams (seperated by spaces or new lines): 100 100 100 100
    The total points scored on all exams was 220 out of a possible total of 400. Making the overall grade average 55.0%.

>Example of expected output:

    Enter the 4 exam scores (seperated by spaces or new lines): 78 45 67 12
    Enter the points possible for the 4 exams (seperated by spaces or new lines): 100 50 75 20
    The total points scored on all exams was 202 out of a possible total of 245. Making the overall grade average 82.4%.
