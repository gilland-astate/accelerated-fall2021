## The Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Any three numbers fitting the Pythagorean Theorem are referred to as a Pythagorean triple. Use nested for loops to generate every possible combination of integer sides less than 100 and display those combinations that are in fact Pythagorean triples. Do not display any unique combination more than once.
