# Exercise 1

Write a simple program that will calculate the time remaining and required gas to reach your destination. 

We will prompt the user to input 3 values: 
* distance to destination (in miles)
* average rate of travel (in miles per hour)
* average fuel consuption (in miles per gallon). 

You will then calculate and output the following 2 values: 
* time remaining (in minutes)
* required gas to reach your destination (in gallons)

Take time to map out your program and be sure that you understand the requirements. Also if you would like you can go a bit further and give a table that gives more information like if the user was to increase their speed slightly in +/- 5 mph increments, how that would affect time remaining.
