# Exercise 2 - Standard Compilation Error Correction

The errors.cpp program contains several syntax and logical errors. Fix all the errors and submit the corrected source file. Once all the errors are fixed, you should be able to reproduce the program output similar to what is (from three separate executions) listed below:

> Example of expected output:

    Enter hours worked:  45
    The net pay is $562.50
    Exiting...

>Example of expected output.

    Enter hours worked:  40
    The net pay is $500.00
    Exiting...

>Example of expected output.

    Enter hours worked:  33.5
    The net pay is $418.75
    Exiting...

Note: In order to get the ideal "currency" output (with exactly 2 decimal places), you need formatted output. Remember to include iomanip.
