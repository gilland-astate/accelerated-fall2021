# Exercise 10 - Functions w/ Reference Params

Write your own code to place two, three and four integers in ascending order.  Do not use any coding techniques other than what we have discussed in class. We will accomplish this by doing the following steps.

1) Write a function, *sort*, that will accept two integers and pass them back in sorted order with the smallest number in the first parameter and the larger number in the second parameter.  Include driver code in function main() that will test this function.

2) Write another function, *sort*, that will accept three integers and pass them back in sorted order with the smallest in the first parameter and the largest in the last parameter.  Include driver code in function main() that will test this function.

3) Write another function, *sort*, that will accept four integers and pass them back in sorted order with the smallest in the first parameter and the largest in the last parameter.  Include driver code in function main() that will test this function.
